        <h3>Autotask</h3>
        <p>I started out at Autotask as a QA intern while attending school. I stayed after I graduated for a total of 7 years in a QA role. I worked there from 2007-2014. </p>
        <h3>Apprenda</h3>
        <p>I moved to Apprenda to move in a different direction for my career. This challenged me at different levels, specifically learning about infrastructure. I worked here until 2017. </p>
        <h3>Commercehub(aka Rithum)</h3>
        <p>I transitioned here to move into management. I became a Lead Software Engineer running an engineering team.  I eventually grew into a Senior Manager role, running the professional services organization. I worked here until 2023. </p>
        <h3>Walgreens</h3>

        <p>Golfing</p>
        <p>I am an avid golder and enjoy it thoroughly!  I always look to improve my game and looking to consistently break 90s. </p>
        <p>Travel</p>
        <p>We love to travel all over the world.  We have been lucky enough to travel to Italy, Switzerland and France.  We most recently took a trip to Alaska! We will be planning a trip to Ireland in 2026.  </p>
        <p>Foodies</p>
        <p>We will never turn down a good meal or experience!</p>
